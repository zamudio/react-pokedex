## React Pokedex
An app built with React to display all original Pokemon and any information associated with them in a quick, responsive, user friendly way

## Motivation
I built this to gain more experience with react and bootstrap, and to have fun.

## How to use?
Go [here](https://pokedex-reacted.netlify.app/) to see a live demo.

The homepage will display all 151 OG Pokemon types with picture and name.
You can click on each card to get more information about the Pokemon, such as:
- pokemon type
- special abilities
- number of steps to hatch
- and many more...
